    """
    Returns two accuracies and classifier:
    NLTK accuracy is the internal accuracy of the classifier
    Manual Accuracy is the accuracy when compared to pre-flagged/known samples and label.

    Keyword Arguments:
    db_name (str) -- Samples database to use, by default this is the same as your trained database
                     with an offset to ensure unseen data. Should be a string database name located in ~/.synt.

    test_samples (int) -- Amount of samples to use, by default this will be 25% of the training set amount.

    neutral_range (float) -- Will be used to drop "neutrals" to see how real-world accuracy will look.
                             For example in the case where neutral range is 0.2 if the sentiment
                             guessed is not greater than 0.2 or less than -0.2 it is not considered.
                             Leaving this set to 0 will not cause the special case drops and will by default
                             categorize text as either positive or negative. This may be undesired as the classifier
                             will treat 0.0001 as positive even though it is not a strong indication.

    offset (int) -- By default the offset is decided from the end of the the trained amount, i.e
                    if you've trained on 1000 and you have 250 testing samples the samples retrieved
                    will be from 1000-1250, you can override this offset if you wish to use a different
                    subset.

    redis_db (int) -- The redis database to use.
